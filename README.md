# Welcome to P.I.G
P.I.G stands for Politically Incorrect Games, but don't worry if you're sensitive, it is only mildy 'incorrect' and in a good natured way.

P.I.G is currently a one man hobby project that focusses on developing retro games (and tools) on/for original (or remakes) classic computers (currently mostly Commodore/Ultimate 64). Perhaps other developers will at some point join in on the fun.

Current developments:
* [asm465](https://github.com/pig-games/asm465): A native (on-device) Editor/Assembler for the Commodore/Ultimate 64
* Various game concepts in very early stages of 'development' (i.e. concept stage)
