# Welcome to P.I.G
P.I.G stands for Politically Incorrect Games, but don't worry if you're sensitive, it is only mildy 'incorrect' and in a good natured way.

P.I.G is currently a one man hobby project that focusses on developing retro games (and tools and sometimes even hardware) for the F256Jr/K New Retro Computers. Perhaps other developers will at some point join in on the fun.

Current developments:
* [YAM3G](https://github.com/pig-games/yam3g): yet another match 3 game (in development).
* Steam Punch: a Steam Punk fighting game, featuring giant steam driven mecha (design and concept fase).
* Development tools:
  - [pngtotile](https://github.com/pig-games/pngtotile): a simple commandline for converting png images to bin files suitable for tiles, sprites or plain bitmaps.
* [Custom F256Jr system case](https://github.com/pig-games/F256-Jr-System-Case) and RaspberryPi (or other SBC) Developer machine companion case.
* [F256 Showcase](https://github.com/pig-games/F256Showcase): a demo/presentation framework for quick creation and playback of guess... demos/presentations.
* [asm465](https://github.com/pig-games/asm465): ON HOLD: A native (on-device) Editor/Assembler for the F256Jr Retro computer
* A joypad controller matching the F256Jr system case design.
